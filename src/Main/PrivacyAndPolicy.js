            <h4>How we hold and protect your personal information</h4>
            <p>
              We are committed to protecting your personal information. We
              implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
              help protect the security of your personal information; however,
              please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have
              implemented various policies including encryption, access, and
              retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and
              unnecessary retention of personal information in our systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              We store personal information we collect in relation to you or
              your applicants in various ways, including in electronic form
              using third party data storage providers. All information that is
              stored electronically is password protected on secure servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              As at the date of this privacy policy, any personal information we
              possess about you will only be stored in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our aim is to ensure that all personal information is securely
              protected from misuse, loss, and unauthorised access, modification
              or disclosure by way of maintaining:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                physical security by preventing unauthorised access to our
                premises;
              </li>
              <li>
                computer network security, including password security to
                prevent unauthorised access;
              </li>
              <li>communication security; and</li>
              <li>
                limiting access to authorised staff and contractors of ON DEMAND
                CHECKS.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When personal information is no longer needed we will take
              reasonable steps to destroy and/or de-identify that information
              (see also the 'Retention' section below).
            </p>
            <p>
              We have current security measures in place to prevent unauthorised
              use of our police check service including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>capturing IP addresses;</li>
              <li>capturing payment information; and</li>
              <li>verification of ID and signatures.</li>

            <h4>
              How can you access to your personal information and correct it if
              it is wrong?
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If necessary, you or your applicants may request access to the
                personal information that we hold about you or them (as
                applicable), under Australian Privacy Principles 12 and 13. We
                will provide this information upon request or otherwise as
                required by law. You may obtain this information by contacting
                us using the details set out below.
              </li>
              <li>
                Under freedom of information (FOI) you have a right, with
                limited exceptions, to access documents held by ON DEMAND
                CHECKS. A FOI request can take up to 30 days to process.

            </ul>
            <p>
              The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act) may give any person
              the right to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                access copies of documents (except exempt documents) we hold;
              </li>
              <li>
                ask for information we hold about you to be changed or annotated
                if it is incomplete, out of date, incorrect or misleading; and
              </li>
              <li>
                seek a review of our decision not to allow you access to a
                document or not to amend your personal record.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We may require you to identify and specify what information and
              documents you require access to. You can ask to see any document
              that we hold. We may refuse access to some documents, or parts of
              documents that are exempt. Exempt documents may include those
              relating to national security, documents containing material
              obtained in confidence, or other matters set out in the FOI Act.
              Other occasions when we may deny access to personal information
              include where release of the information would have an
              unreasonable impact on the privacy of others.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we will endeavour to ensure that the personal information
              collected from you is up to date accurate and complete, we will
              assume that any personal information provided by you is free from
              errors and omissions. If the applicant is able to establish that
              the information we hold about them is not accurate, complete or up
              to date, and the applicant requests us in writing to correct this
              information, we will then take reasonable steps to correct the
              information. You may request that we update or vary personal
              information that we hold about you using the contact details
              listed below.
